# Introduction

This is a tool to visualize how colors will look in a finished woven scarf. Currently it is programmed to match the Selvedge scarf pattern by Julia Wilkins [https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/selvedge]. The user inputs the RGB values they plan to use based on the pattern, and the DrawingPanel will show an image of what the scarf will look like.
